##Video-Sharing DApp

It helps one to upload the videos along with keeping the anonymity of the user as the user logs in through the wallet address.
This decentralised video-sharing application is full of features and different functionalities which make it unique to use. You can share your precious and lovely moments with everyone in the world without any worry about copyright and other technicalities. Along with the feature of likes and comments, it has the option for adding tips for your favorite creators.
It is unique and interesting as it is:

A decentralised space for artists
Provide storage on IPFS
Mint NFTs ensuring unique video uploads
Tips feature just like comments and likes

Challenges I ran into:
It was hard to work for connecting IPFS.
It was a bit hard to find all the dependencies.
