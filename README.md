## Pal Pal : A Decentralized Video Sharing Platform

“Pal Pal” is a decentralized alternative for video content creators.The main theme of Pal Pal “capture your  treasured moments” which you may then share with the entire world without restriction or worry about demonetization. Pal Pal utilises decentralised storage “IPFS” for video storage with metadata and transactions stored on blockchain.Users can like,comment as well as tip their favourite creators,artists.  Pal Pal promotes content production and consumption, with community support serving as a rewarding mechanism and assisting artists in growing as they produce more and more material.


### Main Features

Decentralised video sharing by the use of polygon chain
Use of Ipfs for the video storage
Ability of Donation to content creators
Transparency 
NFT are minted in the address of the video content creators to show the ownership of the video


Furthermore, this overall platform can be extended as a DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) where the content creators engaged with the platform meeting the defined criterias (such as having certain number of platform NFT ownerships, total likes on videos extending certain number, total donations received extending certain amount) could vote on a decision to change things like restricting content, removing certain creators from the platform based on report of user.
